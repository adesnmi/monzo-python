# monzo-python
This is a simple wrapper around the official Monzo API written in Python.

# Quickstart
Make sure you have Python and pip on your machine (this package was built and tested with Python >3.4, but it should work with 2.7, too. Your mileage may vary with other versions).

To install the package run

`pip install monzo`

If the above doesnâ€™t work, you may want to run the above command as an admin by prefixing `sudo`.

# Monzo Python in action
Open up a Python terminal (or create a Python file) and enter the following:

```python
from monzo.monzo import Monzo # Import Monzo Class

client = Monzo('access_token_goes_here') # Replace access token with a valid token found at: https://developers.monzo.com/
account_id = client.get_first_account()['id'] # Get the ID of the first account linked to the access token
balance = client.get_balance(account_id) # Get your balance object
print(balance['balance']) # 100000000000
print(balance['currency']) # GBP
print(balance['spend_today']) # 2000
```

Yup. That easy. To see what more you can do with the client variable, take a look at the [tests](https://github.com/muyiwaolu/monzo-python/blob/master/tests/test_api_endpoints.py).
